# Assignment-2-

One thing I learned

This assignment taught me just how long it can take to do a blog post. Since my topic required a lot of research, I spent lots of time trying to get as much accurate information as possible. I also learned that adding links to your blog is easy and gives you a lot of credibility. Overall, I learned a lot about probioitcs and how to present them to a general audience since you'll never know who may happen to stumble upon reading it. 

 One thing I still am unsure about
 
 I am still unsure about the appropriateness of my layout design. I played around with a lot of designs and the one that I choose seemed to fit my content the best. It wasn't necessarly the most flashy or had the most pictures, but I do think it as a good for my topic. Overall, I spent a lot of time learning new things and changing things in order to suit the overall audience that I believe could be reading my posts.
